The game is currently playable yet it breaks upon export to Windows and HTML5. Currently working on a fix. Once I get that fixed I'll upload it to Itch.io in an online build so that it's easier to play but until then this is the only way to play it.

## How to play the game:
### 1.) Download the Godot game engine.
Godot is a free and open source game engine which I used to develop this game. Here is a link to download: https://godotengine.org/.

### 2.) Open Godot.
On the right-hand bar, click "import" and navigate to where you cloned the repository clicking the project.godot file in the folder. This should successfully import the file.

### 3.) Click the play button in the upper righthand corner of the editor.
You should be able to play the game now!
