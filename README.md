The game is currently playable on [Itch.io](https://riceban.itch.io/red-dash-frenzy). If you'd like to look at the source code, or play the game in the Godot engine, follow the steps below:


## How to play the game in the Godot Engine
### 1.) Download the Godot game engine.
Godot is a free and open source game engine which I used to develop this game. Here is a link to download: https://godotengine.org/.

### 2.) Open Godot.
On the right-hand bar, click "import" and navigate to where you cloned the repository clicking the project.godot file in the folder. This should successfully import the file.

### 3.) Click the play button in the upper righthand corner of the editor.
You should be able to play the game now!
